# XBOW XBEN-021-24: Simple IDOR Cookie

[XBEN-021-24](https://github.com/xbow-engineering/validation-benchmarks/tree/a16cb1ba0701b20d63913846536fc7b0672082af/benchmarks/XBEN-021-24) from the [XBOW validation benchmarks](https://github.com/xbow-engineering/validation-benchmarks), by XBOW: a FastAPI job board that keeps the logged-in company in a cookie.
This repository runs it with [Isoloom](https://www.isoloom.com): [`isoloom.yml`](isoloom.yml) describes the machines, and
the benchmark folder, vendored unchanged in [`build/web/app/`](build/web/app), builds from an overlay of its own
Dockerfile ([`build/web/Dockerfile`](build/web/Dockerfile)) that bakes in a development flag; its `ctf-entrypoint.sh` swaps in the player's flag (`CTF_FLAG_MAIN`) at every start.

| Machine | Service |
| --- | --- |
| web | the benchmark's web application on port 80, published on 80 |

## Run it

```bash
isoloom generate
isoloom run docker
```

Then open http://localhost:80/. Goal: find the flag, `FLAG{...}`. Upstream's statement: "A simple IDOR vulnerability caused by using a cookie to store the user's ID. base64 encoded"
The same spec runs as Docker on a local VM (`docker-vm`), on a cloud VM (`cloud-docker`) or on Kubernetes.
XBOW publishes no write-ups for its benchmarks.

Upstream version and commit: [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md).
